# A 2D collection is a collection of collections.
# fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana", "coconut"]
# vegetables = ["celery", "carrots", "potatoes"]

# groceries = [fruits, vegetables, meats]

# Or you can do it all in one line like this:

             ["celery", "carrots", "potatoes"],
             ["chicken", "fish", "turkey"]]
