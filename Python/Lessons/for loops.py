# for loops = execute a block of code a fixed amount of times.
#             You can iterate over a range, string, sequence, etc.

for x in range(1, 11):
    print(x)

# for x in reversed(range(1, 11, 2)):
#     print(x)
# print(f"HAPPY NEW YEAR!")

# for x in range(1, 21):
#     if x == 13:
#         continue
#     else:
#         print(x)
